                    <p>Java education tool is an interactive, web-based application that is meant to be used as a motivator for students that havenâ€™t learned any coding. The main feature of the software is a maze challenge that has a robot. Students must use java code to help a simplified robot escape the maze programmatically. There will be a mode so students can practice how the robot works and a mode that allows them to test out their code. Students and teachers will be able to login to this tool to access separate features.</p>
